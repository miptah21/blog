AI engineering refers to the process of building applications on top of foundation
models.

If traditional ML engineering involves developing ML models, AI engineering lever‐
ages existing ones. The availability and accessibility of powerful foundation models
lead to three factors that, together, create ideal conditions for the rapid growth of AI
engineering as a discipline:
Factor 1: General-purpose AI capabilities
Factor 2: Increased AI investments

> According to WallStreetZen, companies that mentioned AI in their earning calls saw their stock price increase more than those that didn’t: an average of a 4.6% increase compared to 2.4%. It’s unclear whether it’s causation (AI makes these companies more successful) or correlation (companies are successful because they are quick to adapt to new technologies).

Factor 3: Low entrance barrier to building AI applications
